Library Science for Artists
---------------------------

- Art is For People
  - No one wants "Media Arts"
  - "No one spends more than five minutes with digital literature"
  - Why not? What do they want?
  - Respect their time
- Art is a Growing Organism.
  - Medium is descriptive, not prescriptive:
    - Theatre/Opera is multimedia art
    - Writing: Words on paper != spoken words
    - Phone/Tablet/Laptop & "Device Agnostic"
  - The artist's job is to create.
    - There is no medium, only tools and conventions.
    - Keep on adapting
